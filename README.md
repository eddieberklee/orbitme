Orbits

So it's a more ambient social network where you're not forced to view a linear feed. Cause then people posting, can sometimes feel like they're inundating their friends with too many posts. Also, the UI allows a user to have a view of close friends and friends to interact with - almost serving as a reminder to interact with friends you would normally forget to interact with

Jon: Also the people you forget to and don't want to interact with need to be separated. How do you make that distinction
Me: Based on how often you actually interact with them. It's not perfect but it seems safe to assume if you don't want to interact with them, you won't. So gradually these people will be pushed to more outer rings of your orbit
